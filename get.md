There are a couple of ways to follow along:

 - On [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/allenoleary), become a friend or follow me
 - On [this Twitter account](https://twitter.com/bikebybike)
 - Straight to with a non-spammy email from me - see below
 - This site has an [RSS feed](/feed.xml) for the die-hards amongst you (I love RSS feeds)
 - You can email me allen at allenoleary co uk 
 - I have an [Audax blog](http://audaxery.wordpress.com) with ride reports and that kind of thing

 For the cyclists amongst you I can usually be found quite close to the Audax section of [Yacf.co.uk](https://yacf.co.uk/forum/index.php?board=17.0) as alotronic.

 Straight to your inbox is probably most efficient as it's easy to miss stuff on social. I won't, of course, send you anything other than 'Bike by bike' posts.
