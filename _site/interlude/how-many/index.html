<p>It’s time for a confession. Right at the beginning I said I would write about every bike that I had ever owned, but I haven’t managed that. I left a few out. Quite a few. I’ll out list them below for completeness, but first lets look at some of the issues of bike ownership, some of the contradictions, some of the questions that myself and others have been asked over the years.</p>

<p><b>What is the right number of bikes to own - the n+1 or s-1 formulas</b></p>

<p>This is the cliched answer - the right number of bikes to own is that number you have plus one: n+1. At the heart of it is the understanding that cyclists will always want a better bike, apparently for no good reason at all. That perfectly good bike that you swore would last you ‘a lifetime’ five years ago is now getting a bit boring. You’ve been subjected to years of conditioning, sorry marketing, to which your superior intellect makes you immune, but never-the-less there is that new model that promises 10% more something.</p>

<p>Or it could be about wanting to do a new type of riding. In the last five years the ‘gravel’ bike (or road plus or anyroad) bike has really taken off and is genuinely a great thing to ride a bike away from cars on the byways and green lanes. But of course you need a new type of bike for that.</p>

<p>There are some real world limitations; living in compressed London how big my shed is limits how many bikes I can own at once (six including two family bikes) and then there is the tolerance of your partners or spouses. This is where the formula <em>s-1</em> comes in - one bike less than would lead to separation.</p>

<p><b>How much?</b></p>

<p>Bikes are both extremely expensive and very cheap. It would be very easy to spend £10k on a bike at the moment and even a ‘reasonably good’ bike is hitting £4k these days. There are plenty of great bikes hovering between £1000 and £2000 but they inevitably involve some kind of compromise. A custom steel bike and build is going to be a minimum £2500 and more like £4500. That is quite a bit of cash. Add in the clothing, shoes and so on and it is an expensive hobby compared to, say, table tennis or meditation.</p>

<p>It is very easy to get carried away looking for marginal increases in speed and/or comfort. A very good set of road road wheels is £2000 up. It’s very easy to get caught up in searching for excellent when you really just need good. A good enough set of racing wheels can be had for around £800.</p>

<p>On top of that people spend the money on the wrong things. For racing in particular you want a cheap frame and expensive wheels where most people buy an expensive whole bike and then add expensive wheels. It is easy to put together a great new race bike for less than £2000 (£700 on frame, £800 on wheels, £400 groupset plus bits lying around the shed.) but most race bikes you see at the <em>beginner end</em> of the road racing circuit cost double that. I call that an expensive way to have an accident. And you won’t feel like a tosser if you get dropped on a budget bike. You will, or should, if you are riding Peter Sagan’s bike.</p>

<p>But then again bikes are cheap. A full-house of good enough bikes and a van to go with them is cheap compared to a yacht in a marina. And you will never be able to afford ‘pro level’ racing cars or motorbikes. Or even proper haute-coture or real Prada handbags.</p>

<p><b>Which leads us to ask - what is value?</b></p>

<p>Bikes don’t save me money, I spend about as much on bikes as I would on commuting everyday by Tube. So they don’t cost me much either. But saving money is beside the point at this stage of my life, there are many other benefits.</p>

<p>Riding is a kind of well-being tax. What price physical and mental health? Providing you don’t overdo it and get all weird on it cycling is a great way to have a better quality of life. A cardiologist recently announced my heart was ‘perfect’ - as good as a healthy 35 year old. My circulation is stunning and I can look forward to a longer and better quality of life as I age. For me that offsets the risks of being a Coeliac and the long-term risks that come from being premature, coming from a broken home and growing up with chain smokers.</p>

<p>I try not to take my aerobic fitness for granted or be an arse about it, but I genuinely don’t understand how people can tolerate walking so slowly up stairs. These days I look at people who waddle with a degree of sympathy, but for decades I just saw lazy fat people. The same for those who limp with ‘crip walks’ and hobble in heels and complain about walking for ten minutes - they are missing a whole dimension in life.</p>

<p>The idea that my life happens inside boxes horrifies me even as it is somewhat inevitable in London; one box to live in, one to work in, one more to get you to work and one more to exercise in. A lot of people in London live entirely inside. Then there’s the box I put in a microwave and deliver into my square mouth while I watch funny people on a glowing rectangle while chatting to my friends on another glowing rectangle.</p>

<p>Bikes get you out of boxes and put you in the environment and make you move in arcs and curves. That is so simple and so obvious, but there is a world of benefit in it.</p>

<p>And then there’s the day to day benefit of riding to work. Sure it can be a bit shit on the roads but you arrive at your desk open and aerated, ready to get on with the day, not sweaty from the Tube or battered by another encounter with Southern Rail.</p>

<p>No really, how many bikes?</p>

<p>So the ones I left out were:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A GT mountain bike I bought when I very first got to London. It was hot too, and too small. I gave it to a flatmate and she eventually had it stolen. Karma.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A mountain bike given to me by a Scottish Laird (long story) which I rode for a couple of months before transferring parts to the Rock Lobster. It was too small but got me back on a mountain bike.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Quest road frame. This was a cheap but very light scandium road frame that was very nice. I had ridden it about five times before it was knicked out of the back shed at the same time as the Rock Lobster.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Pinnacle road disc frame. I built this up and rode it once. It was the wrong size and way too high at the front end. I took all the parts off it again and put them back on the Salsa, which luckily hadn’t noticed my unfaithfulness.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Pinnacle hybrid frame, a Lithium. This is actually a very good frame and I enjoyed riding it a couple of times but never really liked flat bars around town. It’s now Steph’s bike, so at least it stayed in the family.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A Giant Anthem X mountain bike. Now this I thought I would write a post about but I haven’t been moved to. It’s a very good mountain bike that replaced the Rock Lobster. But all I want to say about is that it is too good. It makes riding in the forest a bit boring. It is ‘overbiked’. And then I got into Audax - being over 50 I don’t bounce quite as well as I used too.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>So that makes 31 bikes in 52 years, or about 1.25 years per bike averaged out over my riding life. There are readers of this blog who have one bike for many many years (looking at you Brendan) and for whom that will seem profligate, and I guess there are a few who will not even blink at that figure.</p>

<p><b>And the next one?</b></p>

<p>I’ve been making do. I haven’t bought a new frame or bike since 2016 and I will try to get through another few years before I feel like something else. The reason for this is I have one of every type of bike I need and almost enough parts to go around.</p>

<p>I have just rebuilt the Orbea for fast weekend runs and have the Datum for proper distance; the Flyer for fixed and commuting in bad weather and the Anthem X for muddy miles. I certainly don’t <em>need</em> more bikes than that. Some good wheels, maybe. And riding longer distances has made the point that good riding gear is vital so I expect to spend a bit more on good gear over the next couple of years where mostly I have made do.</p>

<p>With the recent demise of the Tripster there is space for a ‘adventure’ bike, but there’s no rush on that. What I really what I need to do now is get off my arse and do some big rides. Or join a club and go for a race. I have the bikes do all of that, it’s the fitness that is lacking.</p>

<p><b>I just like them</b></p>

<p>Despite having all the bikes I need that I still spend more time than is reasonable looking at bikes. I pop into bike shops just to look at bikes. I read reviews. I stop and look at bikes on the street, particularly the odd and strange ones.</p>

<p>I just like bikes. As objects, as minor design problems, as possibilities, as experiences, as reflections of peopls’ personalities - they are good design reads. I guess in the same way someone looks at emsembles of clothing and appreciates and critiques. I am a <em>cyclista</em> as others are <em>fashionistas</em>.</p>

<p>As a child and teen, well before the internet, I used to draw a lot. House plans, yachts, bikes. These days, In the middle of boring meetings (which is to say in the middle of a meeting) I often start to draw houses, yachts and bikes. In the middle of KPIs and annual goals and the kind of language that kills the brain itself my imagination takes to paper yachts and bikes and virtual house in an effort to stay alive. These things have air and light and weather in common; they are objects and experiences and movement wrapped intrinsically together.</p>

<p>Those are the things I like.</p>

<p><b>The perfect bike game</b></p>

<p>Sometimes I play the perfect bike game. It’s pretty easy really; I would have a Genesis Ti Granfondo Disc with Ultegra Di2 and carbon disc wheels. Or maybe a Mason Definition. Or a Fairlight Strael. Or maybe a custom steel bike if I could wait long enough, from Donhou, or Field or Feather or Hartley or Mecredi or… probably the Mason.</p>

<p>About £3.5k new and that would get me through to my mid sixties for 90% of my riding. That’s less than a pound a day. even if I threw in a set of custom built ‘good’ wheels and enough kit to get me around erupoe for a month of very light weight camping it’s still £5k’s worth.</p>

<p>But then I wouldn’t mind one of these new super-fast aero bikes, just because. And I always need a fixie; Woodrup do a nice belt-drive custom fixie that would be perfect. It would also be nice to have a custom classic steel bike to cruise around on, perhaps something that could double as a tourer as well. And a cheap shopper, something off ebay for £100 that I could afford to lose riding around the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>If I bought all of those five bikes new and lush it would cost about £12k. That’s a lot on bikes and more than I would spend on a car ever, but then plenty would think that amount on a car was perfectly reasonable. And of course £12k is nothing on a yacht or a house. I can reach out and touch £12k with my budgets, but my dream home is a million more away and I wouldn’t like myself if I did the kind of work that would get me that money.</p>

<p>So that’s five bikes, not five houses or yachts.</p>

<p>That’s how many I need. Really really need.</p>
