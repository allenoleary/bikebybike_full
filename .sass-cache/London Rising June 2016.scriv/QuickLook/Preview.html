<p class="binderItem"><strong>1- Unwanted and useless</strong><br/>Toby sat with his head in his hands, looking down at his cold plate of porridge. Even if he closed his eyes he couldn’t get rid of Finch, he could still hear Finch’s weasely voice droning on and on, saying the same things he said every day. It was like Finch was a pesky wasp buzzing around the inside of your head. There was no way to get rid of him.<br/>
Toby looked around the table - the others from the attic dorm looked as miserable as he did. June, Robin, Phillip, Vera and his twin sister, Esme. H...</p>

Toby’s jaw dropped. "When was this?" he asked urgently, looking around the breakfast table at the worried faces of the others.<br/>
“Tuesday." said June. "That's four days ago."<br/>
"Where did they land?" asked Toby, who couldn’t believe what he was hearing.<br/>
Robin spoke now, "They took the East Coast ports, Lowestoft, <br/>
Ipswich, South End, Frinton. Then they captured twenty five airfields in a couple of hours."<br/>
"How did they do that?" blurted Toby, "We knew they were coming!"<br/>
"So...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>2 - Leavers</strong><br/>Every child in the orphanage was sent out to the allotment to bring in as many vegetables as they could. The Reds worked shoulder to shoulder, Toby between Esme and Philip, pulling out beets and potatoes -  anything that looked even a little ready. <br/>
‘Laying down a stock’ was how Finch put it.<br/>
It made sense. If the Germans got to London the children would do well to have some food in the cellar, hidden from view. It gave them the option to stay downstairs for at least a week while the fighting - ...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>3 - A radio show</strong><br/><br/>
They all sat at their allotted places in the dining room, nothing unusual in that. What was unusual was that they had been called in from afternoon classes by a flushed, excitable Finch. He had hurried and shooed them into the dining room, smiling and laughing to himself as he did it.<br/>
As soon as they all sat down Finch blew dust off the top of the big radio at the back of the room and switched in on. It hadn't had much use since Mr Cage had left. He used to let everyone listen to music after di...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>4 - Without a trace</strong><br/>The day after the surrender Toby was shaken awake by June. <br/>
“Toby, Toby, there’s something wrong.”<br/>
 Toby sat bolt upright, his head still woozy. He had been having a horrible dream, one where he was looking out of a window at a german tank. Then the turret turned and pointed right at him and then he saw a flash from the barrel as a shell spat out of the tank and came right at him, forcing him to duck.<br/>
“What is it June?”<br/>
“No bell.” she said, her eyes wide with disbelief.<br/>
Toby looked over to their...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>5 - Pethergrew</strong><br/>“Do you know what?” said Robin, sitting down at the table and pulling the leftover porridge pot towards himself, “I think we could do really well out of it.”<br/>
“That’s for the chickens.” said Toby, pulling the pot back to the centre of the table. “And what do you mean ‘do really well’?”<br/>
Robin sighed and put down his spoon. “I reckon if we can grow enough food we could start selling what we don’t need down the Market.”<br/>
“Good idea.” said Toby, nodding. “But first we have to figure out if the church ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>6 - The Message</strong><br/>Despite what Pethergrew said the newspapers did turn up the next morning. And it turned out that Toby was not the only person in Britain who thought the German victory was too easy. The papers were full of articles calling for popular revolt and asking people to form unofficial militia to combat the Germans. Some had only disgust at the King's abandonment of the country a while others praised him for taking the only sensible option, and pointed out that if the King was captured then Britain real...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>7 - The Chop</strong><br/>"What are you going to do?" <br/>
"We've got to immobilise the tram, get rid of the driver then start it up again right?"<br/>
Toby nodded. "Then I can drive it."<br/>
Robin nodded. "That's the dangerous bit."<br/>
"The dangerous bit is being seen and identified. If anyone sympathetic to the Germans sees us and dobs us in we are well and truly dead."<br/>
Robin nodded and quickly looked away. <br/>
Luckily neither of them had a moment to think about what would happen if they were caught by the  Germans because they heard the...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>8  - Free?</strong><br/>Even though things were tense for the Walthamstow Reds for the next couple of days no Germans came knocking at the door. They had bigger things to do. <br/>
The German armies had met in a giant rally in Trafalgar Square, and from there Nazi officers walked into the government buildings on Whitehall to take control.<br/>
The next day the papers led with the story that this new territory would be known as ‘Germania’. June pointed out that this was a mix of Germany and Britannia and so was quite clever reall...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>9 - The Wall</strong><br/>Toby was counting out vegetables and writing the numbers down in Vera’s produce book. She needed to know how much they had of everything so she could plan the winter menus.<br/>
Outside he could see Phillip finishing piling the wood stack. It was taller than it had ever been. They had enough wood to keep the many fireplaces in the house going for months now.<br/>
Phillip was planning to fix up some of the beds and furniture over the winter. June said he should be using winter to learn to write better, but...</p>
